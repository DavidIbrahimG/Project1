# Project1 🚀
Welcome to **Project1** — an **end-to-end data science project** designed to handle data from ingestion to model evaluation. This project integrates all the key aspects of a data science pipeline, ensuring smooth data flow and efficient model management.

### **🛠️ Workflow — ML Pipeline**
This project follows a **structured ML pipeline** to take raw data and transform it into actionable insights. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Collect data from various sources and load it into the system. 🌐
2. **Data Validation**: Check the integrity of the data to ensure it’s ready for processing. 🔍
3. **Data Transformation**: Clean, preprocess, and engineer features from the raw data. 🔄
4. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models on the processed data. 🧑‍💻
5. **Model Evaluation, MLflow, Dagshub**: Evaluate the model’s performance and use **MLflow** and **Dagshub** for versioning and tracking. 📊

### **🔄 Workflows**
To keep things running smoothly, there are several configuration and setup steps. Follow these steps to ensure that everything is properly updated and aligned:

1. **Update `config.yaml`**: This file contains all the crucial configurations for your pipeline. Update it whenever there’s a change in the process or dataset.
2. **Update `schema.yaml`**: Defines the structure of your data. Make sure the schema aligns with your data sources.
3. **Update `params.yaml`**: This file holds the parameters required for model training and other processes. Tweak them based on the needs of your project.
4. **Update the Entity**: The entity layer is the backbone of your project. Make sure to update it as your data evolves.
5. **Update the Configuration Manager in `src/config`**: The configuration manager ensures that all settings are loaded correctly throughout the project. Don’t forget to update it when making changes to configuration files.
6. **Update the Components**: Components are key parts of your pipeline. They include data ingestion, validation, transformation, etc. Update these as necessary for project improvements.
7. **Update the Pipeline**: The pipeline coordinates all tasks. Update it to reflect any changes in the workflow.
8. **Update `main.py`**: This is the entry point for the project. Ensure all the latest changes are reflected here for a smooth execution.
